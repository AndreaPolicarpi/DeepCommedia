# TheDeepComedy
RNN and Transformer models that generate a full cantica in Danteâ€™s style, using the Divine Comedy for training. 
The focus is on:

1) Respecting the hendecasyllabic stucture (lines of eleven syllables, accent on the 10th syllable);

2) Respecting the terza rima rhyme scheme (aba, bcb, cdc, ded, ...).
